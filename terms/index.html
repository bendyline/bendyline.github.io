Please read these terms of use carefully ("Terms"). These Terms govern and apply to your access and use of bendyline.com, qualla.com, prezhero.com, Bendyline's services available via Bendyline's sites and Bendyline's apps (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound all of the terms and conditions described in these Terms. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, do not use our Service.
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any time and without notice. If we do this, we will post the amended Agreement on this page and indicate the date the Agreement was last revised. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").

Use of the Service
</h3>
<p>
Bendyline grants you permission to use the Service as set forth in this Agreement, provided that: (i) you will not copy, distribute, or disclose any part of the Service in any medium; (ii) you will not alter or modify any part of the Service other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Service for its intended purpose; and (iii) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Bendyline servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to use any portion of the Service as a destination linked from any unsolicited bulk messages or unsolicited commercial messages.
</p>
<p>
Bendyline may permanently or temporarily terminate, suspend, or otherwise refuse to permit your access to the Service without notice and liability, if, in Bendyline's sole determination, you violate any of the Agreement, including the following prohibited actions: (i) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (ii) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (iii) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (iv) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (v) interfering with the proper working of the Service; or, (vi) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service. Upon termination for any reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products ("Ideas"). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Bendyline under any fiduciary or other obligation, that we are free to disclose the Ideas on a non-confidential basis to anyone or otherwise use the Ideas without any additional compensation to you. You acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Bendyline does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Bendyline, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.
